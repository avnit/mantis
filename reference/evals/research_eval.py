"""Researcher-stage eval: runs one researcher campaign over a seeded target.

Scores detection recall, cross-file recall, precision, and tokens per true
finding. The other stage benchmarks measure the stages that filter findings;
this one measures the stage that produces them. The toolset is the A/B
variable: same model, same instruction, same target, different tools.

How it works:

* The target (evals/research_target/) is copied into a disposable jail.
  ground_truth.json is excluded from the copy so the model cannot read it.
* The researcher runs with the production tool implementations and reports
  via report_findings; scoring reads the same database the pipeline uses.
* A finding matches a ground-truth entry only if it names one of the entry's
  files and mentions one of its match phrases. Duplicates of a matched entry
  do not hurt precision; deduplication is a different stage's job.
* cross_file_recall is reported separately because source-to-sink flows that
  cross files are what structural navigation tools should improve.

Usage:

    # Via the benchmark runner (model sweep, table output):
    python3 evals/run_eval.py --stage research --runs 3

    # Direct, single configuration, explicit toolset:
    python3 evals/research_eval.py --model vertex_ai/gemini-3.7-flash \\
        --effort low --toolset baseline --json-out /tmp/baseline.json
